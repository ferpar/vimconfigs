# Vim Configurations

Here I'll be storing my configs for vim, alongside any useful information
related to my vim setup, so that it can be easily shared across different
devices.

## Configurations

- T15: the one I'm using at my thinkpad. Also using zsh on the terminal with
  powerlevel9k oh-my-zsh theme.
